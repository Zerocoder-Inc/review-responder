We honestly had so much fun... and even got a tour of the kitchen and met Chef Thomas Keller at the end of our meal. Get the wine pairings and sit back and relax. Service is exceptional,  food is amazing and inventive. Pictures barely do the night justice. Loved it.",

Each dish was perfect and the timing of delivery was on point. They even let me see the kitchen after I was finished. I will definitely try to be back on my next visit to the city",

        "text": "Per Se is an iconic New York restaurant by The French Laundry’s chef, Thomas Keller. It doesn’t disappoint: the appetizers, cheeses and desserts from the tasting menu are some of the best food we’ve ever had in New York. I’d highlight the impeccable oysters with caviar, the tomato and heart of palm salad, the cheese pastry with truffles, the chocolate chai pudding, and the cappuccino ice cream. The view from the tables is gorgeous. Service is also top notch and delightfully friendly (feels like you’re not on Manhattan - chuckles).\n\nWe just weren’t as impressed with the meat dishes - the crab pierogi was good, but not mouth-dropping; the chicken was the best of the three, but still not awe inspiring; and the lamb prime rib tasted blander and less tender than we hoped.\n\nI’m giving 4/5 stars only because, when you pay this high a price for a meal, my expectations are that every step of it will be moving and memorable. This was the case with a good part of the menu, but far from all of it. Still worth the visit, in my opinion!",

Everyone congratulated him, including the chief, who served him extra dessert. As a special treat, we visited the kitchen. My son told me we had to go back to this restaurant afterward because it is so great! lol",
